# API

This directory contains API route handlers and endpoint logic.

## Structure

Organize API endpoints by feature:
- `phishing_routes.py` - Phishing detection endpoints
- `health_routes.py` - Health check and status endpoints
- `middleware.py` - Custom middleware functions

## Best Practices

- Keep route handlers clean and focused
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- Return consistent JSON responses
- Implement proper error handling
- Add request validation
